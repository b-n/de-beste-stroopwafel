# Stroopwafel Testing Process

In order to achieve results that are consistent with scientific best practise,
a double blind test will be created to test the participants level of
desireability of different types of stroopwafels.

## Preparation

Stroopwafels come from many different manufacturers, and thus can take
different forms. The differences can come from multiple different factors
including (but not limited to):

- Stroop amount
- Stroop texture
- Wafel thickness
- Wafel crunchynes
- Sweetness
- Ingredients used
- Variations between batches

All of the above factors can influence a persons feelings about a particular
stroopwafel.

As the whole stroop wafel includes all of the stroopwafel including the
perimeter, then the sampling of the stroopwafels will include this outer
perimiter, and be cut accordingly to ensure that all parts of the stroopwafel
are considered.

### Stroopwafel selection

There has been a recent increase in variations of flavours for stroopwafels, 
however this study will focus on stroopwafels with the "standard" flavour. This 
might include particular brands which offer an increased stroop volume as this 
doesn't change the "standard" flavour, but just caters to peoples interest of 
stroopwafels that contain more stroop.

This study will therefore consider the following stroopwafels:

- Albert Heijn branded stroopwafel - Standard
- Albert Heijn branded stroopwafel - Caramel (more stroop version)
- Albert kyuip market stroopwafel
- Vomar branded stroopwafel
- Dirk branded stroopwafel

In order to maintain consistency in the results, if many packets of stroopwafels 
are required from the same manufacturer, then batch numbers will be located to 
ensure that they are from the same batch to reduce the variance from each 
manufacturer.

### Stroopwafel cutting

In order to achieve this cut, a stroopwafel will be cut into 8 segements by 
cutting along the midpoint on 4 differents axes, makes sure that each section
represents 1/8th of the stroopwafel. Detailed description as follows:

- First cut through the middle of the stroopwafel
- Second cut perpendicular to the first, through the middle
- Third cut through the middle, between the first and second cuts at a 45
  degree angle to the middle cross section
- Fourth cut the same as previous, however on the other uncut 90 degree section

The above description is the same way that a "normal sane" person would slice
a pizza.

### Preparation into batches

## Execution of testing

To ensure a scientific best approach, the stroopwafels will be administered
to participants through a double blind approach. This will be executed as follows:

- The person doing the preparation will prepare the stroopwafel batches by
  themselves without outside interuption
- The stroopwafels will be placed into resealable bags, which will be numbered.
  The numbering will be kept for reference on a sheet which is hidden from the 
  participants.
- The executer will take the numbered bags, and separate them into separate
  bowls at random, ensuring no cross mixing between samples. The bowls will be
  tracked with a number beneath the bowl to indicate which sample belongs to
  which bowl

To further ensure a random sampling, each participant will be required to do a
random blind draw from a bag containing the sampling order. The draw will
specify which stroopwafels need to be sampled in which order. The participant
will then be required to sample the stroopwafels in the order specified by
their random selection. From there, the participant will be requested to rank
their samples that they have tested, however they have no requirement to give
rankings to all stroopwafel samples. 1 should be used to indicate which
sample was deemed to be the tastiest by the participant.

### Delivering through double blind


## Considerations for results

- Not all stroopwafels will be consistent in the batches
- The top and/or bottom stroopwafels may be in contact with the packaging and 
  thus this might affect the taste
- The selected batches might not be representational of the manufacturers 
  average stroopwafel
