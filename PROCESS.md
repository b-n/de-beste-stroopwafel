# Stroopwafel Testing Process

In order to achieve results that are consistent with scientific best practise,
a double blind test will be created to test the participants level of
desireability of different types of stroopwafels.

## Preparation

Stroopwafels come from many different manufacturers, and thus can take
different forms. The differences can come from multiple different factors
including (but not limited to):

- Stroop amount
- Stroop texture
- Wafel thickness
- Wafel crunchynes
- Sweetness
- Ingredients used
- Variations between batches

All of the above factors can influence a persons feelings about a particular
stroopwafel.

As the whole stroop wafel includes all of the stroopwafel including the
perimeter, then the sampling of the stroopwafels will include this outer
perimiter, and be cut accordingly to ensure that all parts of the stroopwafel
are considered.

### Stroopwafel selection

There has been a recent increase in variations of flavours for stroopwafels, 
however this study will focus on stroopwafels with the "standard" flavour. This 
might include particular brands which offer an increased stroop volume as this 
doesn't change the "standard" flavour, but just caters to peoples interest of 
stroopwafels that contain more stroop.

This study will therefore consider the following stroopwafels:

- Albert Heijn branded stroopwafel - Standard
- Albert Heijn branded stroopwafel - Caramel (more stroop version)
- Albert kyuip market stroopwafel
- Vomar branded stroopwafel
- Dirk branded stroopwafel

In order to maintain consistency in the results, if many packets of stroopwafels 
are required from the same manufacturer, then batch numbers will be located to 
ensure that they are from the same batch to reduce the variance from each 
manufacturer.

### Stroopwafel sampling

Although sampling the whole stroopwafel would be ideal, this could lead to 
participants not being able to complete the sampling of all stroopwafels due to 
the volume of stroopwafel to be consumed. In addition to this, the first and 
last stroopwafel of each packet will be set aside as these are in more contact 
with the packaging which could lead to varied results.

In order to achieve a sampling size that is suitable for the participants to 
consume, the stroopwafels will be cut into 8 segements. This will be achieved by
cutting along the midpoint on 4 differents axes, to make sure that each section
represents 1/8th of the stroopwafel. Detailed description as follows:

- First cut through the middle of the stroopwafel
- Second cut perpendicular to the first, through the middle
- Third cut through the middle, between the first and second cuts at a 45
  degree angle to the middle cross section
- Fourth cut the same as previous, however on the other uncut 90 degree section

The above description is the same way that a "normal sane" person would slice
a pizza.

### Preparation into batches

After the sampling of the stroopwafels has been completed, each set of samples 
will be put into bags labeled with a sample number. The number will be recorded 
on the record sheet along with the manufacturer and other details regarding to 
the stroop waffel, including:

- Location of purchase
- Brand/Manufactuer information
- Purchase date
- Packaging date (if possible)
- Expiry date (if possible)
- Batch number (if possible);

These batches of stroopwafels are now ready to be provided to the test executer. 
The test executer should never know which stroopwafel belongs to which 
manufactuer to remove bias when randomising the samples for consumption.

## Execution of testing

Following the practise of a double blind trial, the following procedure will be 
administered:

- The person doing the preparation will prepare the stroopwafel batches by
  themselves without outside interuption
- The stroopwafels will be placed into resealable bags, which will be numbered.
  The numbering will be kept for reference on a sheet which is hidden from the 
  participants and test executer
- The executer will take the numbered bags, and separate the stroopwafel samples 
  into separate bowls at random, ensuring no cross mixing between samples. The
  bowls will be tracked with a number beneath the bowl to indicate which sample
  belongs to which bowl number

To further ensure a random sampling, each participant will be required to do a
random blind draw from a bag containing the sampling order. The draw will
specify which stroopwafels need to be sampled in which order. The participant
will then be required to sample the stroopwafels in the order specified by
their random selection. From there, the participant will be requested to rank
their samples that they have tested, however they have no requirement to give
rankings to all stroopwafel samples. 1 should be used to indicate which
sample was deemed to be the tastiest by the participant.

A sample of the sampling sheet is as follows:

| Bowl Number | Ranking | Remarks |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| Bowl 1      |         |         |
| Bowl 5      |         |         |
| Bowl 4      |         |         |
| Bowl 3      |         |         |
| Bowl 2      |         |         |

As per the above example, the particpants will sample each of the stroopwafels
in the order as dictated. Participants will be able to leave comments in the 
remarks column if it helps them to make a discission between samples. The 
comments will not be further analysed in the results to ensure the focus is 
purely on the overall stroopwafel preference.

## Collating the results

As the test executor is able to randomly distribute the samples into bowls that 
are not numbered with the same batch, then some mapping of bowl numbers to 
sample numbers needs to take place to ensure the results are collated correctly.

The results will first of all need to be tabulated overall. The results should 
take all participants results, and tabulate each bowl with each score, lining up 
all of the scores as follows:

| Participant Id | Bowl 1 | Bowl 2 | Bowl 3 | Bowl 4 | Bowl 5 |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1              |      1


## Considerations for results

- Not all stroopwafels will be consistent in the batches
- The top and/or bottom stroopwafels may be in contact with the packaging and 
  thus this might affect the taste
- The selected batches might not be representational of the manufacturers 
  average stroopwafel
